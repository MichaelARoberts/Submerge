## Submerge Forensic Utilities

### Intro
Submerge is an ongoing project to help digital investigators gain access to information quickly, and as beautifully as possible. Submerge uses Python as it's backend. 

### Why Submerge?
While Linux is the default for many investigators, it still has many downsides. Hashing a single file is easy, but what about the directory and and all the files within? What is the most efficient method of hashing and generating hex at the same time? My desire for speed, ease of use, and a decent UI lead me to create this library.

### What's Required?
Any terminal, and a markdown viewer to read results in .md files.

### What's Included?
The library has numerous parts they are as follows

- submerge, this is the main control file and controls everything
- hex_util, this generates and reads hex data
- hash_util, this generates hashes for files
