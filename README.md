## Submerge Forensic Utilities

### Intro
Submerge is an ongoing project to help digital investigators gain access to information quickly, and as beautifully as possible. Submerge uses Python as it's backend. 

### Why Submerge?
I wanted a method that could hash and hex a file, that would produce numerous types of results beyond what the hashsum utilities in linux provide. I also wanted a base for many other tools I might develop.

### What's Required?
Any terminal, and a markdown/textviewer viewer to read results in .md files.

### What's Included?
The library has numerous parts they are as follows

- submerge, the file to run
- hex_util, this generates and reads hex data
- hash_util, this generates hashes for files
